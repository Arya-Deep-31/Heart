# Heart-Disease-Analysis

The continuous surge in heart disease cases is becoming an alarming concern, emphasizing the utmost importance of early disease prediction. Accurate and efficient diagnosis is key to identifying at-risk individuals and taking timely preventive measures. This paper is dedicated to predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on a comprehensive set of medical attributes.

Through extensive efforts, I have developed a  heart disease prediction system that intelligently utilizes patients' medical histories for precise classification. Employing a diverse range of machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, support vector machine,  k-nearest neighbors, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classification, I sought to achieve optimal prediction and classification outcomes.
