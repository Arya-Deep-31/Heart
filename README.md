# Heart-Disease-Analysis

The continuous surge in heart disease cases is becoming an alarming concern, emphasizing the utmost importance of early disease prediction. Accurate and efficient diagnosis is key to identifying at-risk individuals and taking timely preventive measures. This paper is dedicated to predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on a comprehensive set of medical attributes.

Through extensive efforts, I have developed a  heart disease prediction system that intelligently utilizes patients' medical histories for precise classification. Employing a diverse range of machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, support vector machine,  k-nearest neighbors, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classification, I sought to achieve optimal prediction and classification outcomes.

DATASET

An organized dataset of individuals was carefully selected, considering their heart health history and other relevant medical conditions. Heart diseases encompass a range of conditions affecting the heart, and according to the World Health Organization (WHO), they are the leading cause of mortality among middle-aged individuals.

 The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, comprises medical records of 1025 patients which had duplicae entries too and was reduced to 302 unique data from various age groups. These records contain essential medical attributes such as age, resting blood pressure, and fasting sugar levels, crucial for detecting the presence of heart disease in patients. The dataset consists of 13 medical attributes for each patient, facilitating classification into those at risk and those not at risk of heart disease. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, containing 302 rows and 13 columns in total. Each row represents a unique record, and 'Table 1' lists all attributes.
